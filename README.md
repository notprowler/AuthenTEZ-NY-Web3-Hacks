# AuthenTEZ-NY-Web3-Hacks


AuthenTEZ uses the Tezos blockchain and NFC (like what's in smartphones) to make sure products are real.

AuthenTEZ is built with tools called SmartPy and Taquito to work with blockchain easily.

This system makes use of blockchain's security to keep product info safe and uses NFC because it's cheap and everyone has it on their phone. We made sure AuthenTEZ can handle loads of NFC tags without harming the environment.

To keep things extra secure, we used password-protected NFC tags to stop copying, update the tag info each time it's checked to outsmart fakes, and even check the product's history on different blockchains to spot any malicious intents.
